## VBA-challenge

# Summary

In this challenge, we explored using VBA to analyze stock data already provided to us.

For each stock for each year, we analyzed three things:
- Yearly change in the stock value
- Percentage change in the stock value in that year
- Total stock volume exchanged in that year

Using this data we also found out which stocks had the highest and lowest percentage change over that specific year and which stock had most volume exchanged.
